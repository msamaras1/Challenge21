# Application

## Challenge: Martian Token Crowdsale

This exercise will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that was created will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

### Instructions

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

1. Using MetaMask and Ganache configure the testing environment
2. Use Remix to develop and test the contract
3. Using testing addresses available through MetaMask test the deployment
